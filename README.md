# Course project for Cyber Security Base 2020

The "mysite" app is a course project for Cyber Security Base 2020 course that is held in University of Helsinki. The point is to flaw an app with at least five vulnerabilities that are found in the [OWASP Top Ten list of cyber security vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

The "mysite" app is based on the app that is created in Django's [Writing your first Django app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/) -tutorial. The "mysite_original" directory holds the original version of the app (which has not been flawed with vulnerabilities) and the "mysite" directory holds the flawed one with vulnerabilities.

The "documentation" directory holds a report of the vulnerabilities that are created. It also contains information on how to fix these issues.

More details about the course can be found in [course's webpage](https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi/module-3.1).
